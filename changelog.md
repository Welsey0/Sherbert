- Debugify is no longer an Actions build
- FastQuit & ThreadTweak Actions builds updated
- 7 other updates
- Updated MUtils RAM warnings
- Added Packet Fixer & Graceful Packets
- Removed redundant fabric overrides
- Iris is now disabled by default instead of just having no shader selected. Hopefully this helps with Iris' resource-hungriness even when there is no active shader
